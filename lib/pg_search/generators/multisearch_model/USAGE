Generates a new ActiveRecord 'document' model for a custom global search index (i.e in addition to or instead of PgSearch::Document).

Where NAME is the class name of the model to generate.

To create an PrivateDocument global index:

    rails g pg_search:multisearch_model PrivateDocument

This just runs the model generator and updates the new model with the needed
glue.

  rails g pg_search:multisearch_model PrivateDocument tsearch

Will generate a migration to add a tsvector column for tsearch. The same can be
done with 'dmetaphone' as well. Make sure the model generator has been run once
without tsearch before running it with.

Finally, in the class body of records to include in the PrivateDocument index:

    include PgSearch
    multisearchable({
      'PrivateDocument' => {
        :against => [:title, :body, :author],
	:if => :draft?
      }
    })

You can use as many different document classes as you'd like.
